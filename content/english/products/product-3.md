The engines of FAST tamping rammers connect with the crankcase. The torque generated by engine is transferred to crank gear through the centrifugal clutch, after decelerating, the torque is changed to up and down reciprocating motion. When setting the high-duty spring up and down, the strong impacting force is generated through the acting force both of up and down motion and the machineâ€™s weight.
